Description: Clinical sequencing of tumor is usually performed on formalin-fixed
    and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and have many sequencing errors. We 
    found that the majority of these errors are detected in chimeric reads 
    caused by single-strand DNA with microhomology. Our filtering pipeline
    focuses on the uneven distribution of the artifacts in each read and 
    removes such errors in FFPE samples without over-eliminating the true 
    mutations detected in fresh frozen samples.
