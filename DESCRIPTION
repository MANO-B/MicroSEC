Description: Clinical sequencing of tumor is usually performed on formalin-fixed
    and paraffin-embedded samples and have many sequencing errors. We found that
    the majority of these errors are detected in chimeric read caused by
    single-strand DNA with micro-homology. Our filtering pipeline focuses on the
    uneven distribution of the artifacts in each read and removes such errors in
    formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples without over-eliminating the
    true mutations detected in fresh frozen samples.
