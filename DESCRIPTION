Description: Clinical sequencing of tumor is usually performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and have many sequencing errors. We found that the majority of these errors are detected in chimeric reads caused by single-strand DNA with microhomology. Our filtering pipeline, MicroSEC, focuses on the uneven distribution of the artifacts in each read and removes such errors in FFPE samples without over-eliminating the true mutations detected in fresh frozen samples.
