Description: Clinical sequencing of tumor is usually performed on formalin-fixed
    and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and have many sequencing errors. We
    found that the majority of these errors are detected in chimeric read
    caused by single-strand DNA with microhomology. Our filtering pipeline
    focuses on the uneven distribution of the artifacts in each read and removes
    such errors in FFPE samples without over-eliminating the true mutations
    detected in fresh frozen samples.
